             <p> “[A] searing, deeply researched account…An eye-opening, urgent book that demands an end to inequality as a matter of life and death.” —Kirkus (starred review)</p>

            <p>"Lucid and well researched, this is an eye-opening call for rethinking the nature of accidents." —Publishers Weekly</p>

            <p>“A brilliant and alarming analysis, imbued with empathy and appropriate rage, of a tragic, far-too-common problem.” —Booklist (starred review)</p>

            <p>“With deep documentation, Jessie Singer demonstrates how the false culture of ‘accidents’ as ‘unforeseen and unplanned events’ is a convenient cover for corporate crimes,  negligence, and sheer greed. Whether on the highways, in the workplaces, or in the marketplaces, Singer illuminates how powerful interests could be acquired in many ways to prevent or mitigate the horrific casualties which now are profitably blamed on their victims. After reading this book, you’ll recoil when you hear the word ‘accident.’” —Ralph Nader</p>

            <p>“Provocative and illuminating. Like Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed, There Are No Accidents trains a spotlight on the powerful interests that benefit by framing accidents as the fault of reckless individuals rather than hazardous systems. An important book that deserves a wide readership—and that will make you think twice before ever labeling something an ‘accident’ again.” —Eyal Press, author of Dirty Work and Beautiful Souls</p>

            <p>
              “As a cyclist for nearly four decades, I’ve suffered my share of broken bones and scraped skin, concussion, fear and loathing—all, as Jessie Singer brilliantly shows, were not accidents. I’ve seen it in epidemics, where human actions aid the microbes. And in the floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires I have covered. Singer’s clarion call is spot on: confront the systems and powers that choose blame over prevention.” —Laurie Garrett,  Pulitzer Prize–winning author of I Heard the Sirens Scream            </p>

            <p>“A furiously researched, lucidly written book. Singer leads us, almost without our realizing it, to consider our own willingness to explain away disastrous events instead of confronting their systemic causes. She persuasively tells her readers that the sooner we quit thinking that way, the better off we will be.” —Christopher Bonanos, city editor of New York magazine and author of Flash: The Making of Weegee the Famous            </p>

            <p>“I’ve been waiting for a book that would confront, head-on, the dauntingly complex, inevitably tragic, and often widely misunderstood nature of unintentional death and injury. With deep research, clearly expressed insight, and proper indignation, Jessie Singer has delivered admirably.” —Tom Vanderbilt, author of Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)
            </p>
            
            <p>“As this brilliant book makes clear, death or injury from accidents is very much a function of wealth and power. And if we really learn that fact, we might take the steps necessary to reduce the toll of these traumas.” —Bill McKibben, author of The Flag, the Cross, and the Station Wagon
            </p>


            <p>“In this fascinating work, Singer challenges the reader to consider whose deaths are brushed off as ‘accidents,’ which communities suffer the most from ‘accidental’ harm, and who can use ‘It was just an accident!’ as a get- out-of-jail-free card. This essential book will make you angry, and change the way you see the world.” —Kim Kelly, author of Fight Like Hell: The Untold History of American Labor
